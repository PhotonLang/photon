# Photon
A hypersafe and fast language for manipulating Images.


Heavily WIP

I was insipred to make this project by: https://github.com/f-stop-lang because it was a cool idea and I wanted to make my own version, and I felt like I could improve on it. Credit goes to this project for the idea!


## Intended Syntax
```
OPEN 'image.png' AS image
APPLY 'solarize' TO image
SAVE image TO 'solarized-image.png'
```

Photon is supposed to be an easy language to work with, as its primary focus is manipulating images, its not a general purpose language.


## Some ideas

1. Change File Extension
2. Possible change `TOSYS` to just `TO` however `TOSYS` strongly shows a save to the system rather than to a variable identifier

Please feel free to make issues with your ideas!
